#Artifical Neural Network

This repository contains a few of my implementations of an artifical neural network.

The implementations are primarily based on a free online book on the subject, written by Michael Nielsen and available for free at: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html

The data used is the MNIST data set of handwritten digits, freely available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
